## [Unreleased]
### Added
- Added new region Alola
- Added Meltan and Melmetal to region dataset as name "LetsGo" ("ピカブイ" in Japanese).

### Changed
- Added Hoopa and Volcanion to Kalos region.

## [0.1.2] - 2020-12-07
### Changed
- Bumped required Ruby version to 2.7.1 from 2.3.0 because `Object#then` is used in this project. Thus this version won’t work in Ruby whose version is older than 2.6.0.

## [0.1.1] - 2020-12-07
### Changed
- Changed gem name to "pokemon" from "pokedex" because gem name "pokedex" has already been taken in [RubyGems.org](https://rubygems.org).

## [0.1.0] - 2020-12-07
### Added
- First release. But this version won’t work because of a invalid gem name.
